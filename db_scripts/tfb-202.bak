2	3	Expansion and quality of surface	Let the dough rise at least 2x, up to 3x, until bubbles start to form on top.	\N
5	5	Expansion and surface of dough	When is dough is optimally proofed?	- The dough surface is smooth, with perhaps small bubbles forming, but no cracks. <br>- The top seems to have stopped expanding. <br>- The boule has settled into the basket but still maintains a slight dome shape.
9	6	Color of crust	To taste, of course; I'm looking for dark brown with tips of black on the "ears" (the raised ridges caused by the scoring).	The bottom of my loaves is often nearly black. You can always cut off the burned parts, but have a bite first. A little charcoal-y bitterness might be surprisingly enjoyable.<br>
7	2	Mixed dough	Mix until dough is completely uniform, is slightly stretchy, and holds together in a ball.	No need to have a smooth surface; that will come with folding during fermentation.
6	5	The poke test	Poke the dough with a floured or wet finger. Look for a noticeable rebound.	- A fast rebound means more proofing is required; no rebound at all and the dough may be over-proofed. <br>- The poke test always seems to give me the same slight rebound regardless of timing. An area for learning.
8	3	Elasticity and Extensibility	Extensible dough can be stretched. Elastic dough returns to its original shape after stretching.	I have no problems making dough stretchy, but elasticity is often lacking. Area for improvement.
10	6	Height of finished loaf	My key measurement: 8cm or higher makes me happy.	- My highest ever 100% WW was 8.5cm (loaves #63 and #86, both with added commercial yeast); overnight loaves (with only starter) peak at 7.5 (loaf #83) and are usually 6's and 7's and sometimes 5's. <br>- Adding white flour will bump up this metric easily.<br>- BTW I don't usually measure width as the loaf generally settles into the bottom of the dutch oven enough so width is always the same.
11	6	Aroma	Always wonderful, sour overnight loaves are especially wheaty-yeasty-funky.	\N
12	6	Crumb	The bigger the bubbles in the dough, the opener the crumb.	\N
13	6	Moisture	Higher hydration doughs result in baked bread moist to the touch.	\N
14	6	Texture	Chewy goodness, a little crunch in the crust, not gummy.	\N
15	6	Taste	Longer fermentation means more sourness and complexity.	\N
16	6	Scoring/Ears	Mine are usually minimal at this juncture.	\N
3	4	Shape of boule	How round it is.	\N
4	4	Surface of boule	How smooth it is.	\N
1	3	Windowpane test	Wet your hands, grab a small ball of dough, and pat and stretch it.	- Roughly,&nbsp; "short" dough is stretchy enough to <em>start</em> to make a window but tears easily; "improved" will hold the windowpane but with thicker veins in it and with some tearing (though the holes maintain a circular shape); "intensive" is uniform, without veins, and won't tear. <br>- With 100% Whole Wheat, getting to "short" is hard enough. <br>- Usually this test is done after mixing, but my dough won't develop fully until after folding. More folds are what bring it up to short.<br>

5	5	Proof	More rising time for the dough	- I use a large bowl to cover the banneton so the dough has room to grow in case it rises above the edges of the basket.<br>
1	1	Autolyse	A fancy term for mixing flour and water	- I just use water from the tap—at room temperature, unless I'm in a hurry.<br>- Don't worry about dissolving all the salt; it's fine if bits remain.<br>
2	2	Mix	Combine&nbsp;<em>autolyse</em>&nbsp;and starter and salt to make the dough	- OPTIONAL: add 6g instant commercial yeast to finish fermentation in ~3 hours<br>- I assume the starter itself is 1:1 flour:water. If not the ratios will change.<br>- The pinch-and-fold technique is described here ... TODO<br>- As you mix, the dough becomes <em>somewhat</em> smooth, elastic, and extensible.<br>
3	3	Ferment including folding	Rising time, folding in the first hour	- To fold, wet a hand, slip it a quarter of the way or so under the dough, and raise it up, letting the dough stretch and slide over the side of your hand, and using the weight of dough to anchor the stretch. Pull the stretchy band over the top of the dough, tucking the end down around the opposite side from which you started.<br>- I like to do 5 stretches per fold, rotating the bowl as you do so, as if performing some sort of star-shaped gesture.<br>- You can do more than 5 folds per loaf if maybe the dough seems overly loose or tears too easily.<br>- When the bubbles pop and the top starts to shrink down and crack, you've waited too long (but keep going, things will work out, probably)<br>- This step is called "bulk fermenting" because if the dough will make 2 or more loaves it is fermented in bulk, in one lump. Individual loaves are separated at shaping, the next step.<br>
6	6	Bake	Time for heat to finish the magic	- Sometimes if the dough is very sticky and/or there's not enough flour on the basket, the dough will stick to the basket (or liner, if using). Curses! Remove carefully to avoid stretching the dough.<br>- Scoring requires a sharp knife or lame. I have difficulty keeping the edge of the lame from sticking, though. Sometimes I use scissors to clip little tents in some pleasing design. Anyway, I'm definitely <em>flailing</em> with scoring at the moment.<br>- I like a darker bake, with a dark brown crust and the beginnings of a slightly burned-toast aroma, perhaps a minute or two past the 45 total<br>- Waiting till cool—a couple hours at least or, for me, overnight—makes a better inner texture and crispy crust. On the other hand: warm bread!<br>- Once I used a cheap, thin brand of parchment. It bonded irrevocably to the crust. Bad parchment!&nbsp;<br>
4	4	Shape	Form the dough into a <em>boule</em> and put into a basket, or <em>banneton</em>, to proof	- The quickest step and also the most complex! Lots of details here<br>- <strong>Flouring:</strong>Sprinkle a fine layer of flour around the sides and bottom of the banneton (or on the liner if using). Sprinkle a bit of flour, not too much, on a flat surface. Then sprinkle the top of the dough. Cast the flour with your fingers so it hits the side of the bowl and piles up a bit so you can press down the side with the scraper and have the flour follow down along.<br>- <strong>"Easing" (key word) the dough out of the bowl:</strong>Take the curved scraper, dip it in flour, and work your way carefully around the bowl, dislodging the dough from the sides, keeping as much gas in the dough as possible. Finally slowly roll the dough out of bowl, upside down, on to the floured surface.<br>- <strong>Stretching:</strong>Take the flat scraper and slide it part way under the dough, hold down gently on top, and stretch the dough out a small amount. Do this on each corner, still keeping gas in the dough, making a somewhat rectangular shape. You'll see the holes in the dough elongate as you stretch it, which may (?) open the crumb a bit.<br>- <strong>Gathering:</strong>Now use the scraper to fold a long side of the dough over the top of itself. Do the same with the opposite side, to make a sort of a log. Then fold up the ends of the log to the center and hold the top together with your floured hands. Gather the edges up into a sphere. Now invert the dough so the seams at the top are now at the bottom. Whew!<br>- If you want to increase the likelihood of natural scoring, try dumping some flour in the edges at the top of the dough as you gather it up, before inverting.<br>- <strong>Shaping:</strong>Flouring your fingers as necessary to keep them from sticking to the dough, hold it on the bottom edges and pull it across the flat surface so as to create tension in the surface of the boule. Rotate the boule one-quarter and pull again, keep any seams under the boule. Repeat 5-8 times.<br>- If the dough is too sticky despite all the flouring, an alternative is to wet the scrapers, the flat surface, and your hands. Shaping doughs with 90% or higher hydration is much easier this way<br><br>

2	Narrow spatula	For stirring the sourdough starter and getting it out of the jar	<a href="https://upgood.com/product/jar-spatula/">This little beauty</a> serves the purpose perfectly
3	Metal bowl	Typical kitchen bowl, 4-quart size is good for both mixing and fermenting	I used to use a transparent 4-liter <a href="https://www.cambro.com/Products/food-storage/round-storage-containers/camwear-rounds/">Cambro round plastic container</a> in order to measure exactly how much the dough expands. I still recommend it, though this brand is not BPA-free.
4	Lid for the metal bowl	Whatever works for you!	I use <a href="https://www.amazon.sg/Elegant-Live-Resistant-Microwave-Cover/dp/B01DFG8RUK">the big one of these</a> flat silicone lids—easy to cover/uncover the bowl during folding
5	Kitchen scale	Much more exact than cups, though less rustic	When my scale ran out of batteries, I <em>ran</em> to the store to immediately get more. Indispensable.
6	Round plastic scraper	For scaping down the sides of the bowl and easing out the dough	<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CG8DOEC">This one</a> is quite good.
8	Proofing basket	For letting the shaped <em>boule</em> rise	Putting dough directly on the floured baskets creates those visually appealing horizontal lines of flour on the baked loaf. Using the liner allows a smoother surface.
9	Parchment paper	To transfer proofed dough to the dutch oven	It should not stick to the dough. If it does, try another brand.
10	5-qt cast iron dutch oven	For baking	Baking stones work too but dutch ovens are easier. They create their own steam; using a stone requires misting the oven in some way.
7	Flat scraper	For shaping and clean-up	Plastic, metal, what-have-you
11	Cooling rack	For cooling the baked loaf	Pretend it's a big cookie
1	Glass jar	To store and nurture the sourdough starter	- I love my Weck jars, though they're a little on the expensive side. Straight sides are required, and a lid. <br>- Old peanut butter jar? Sure

2	1	Hydration: the amount of water	The amount of water—its weight as a percentage&nbsp; of the weight of the flour in the dough	- In this recipe I use 85% hydration (425g water / 500g flour. For me it's a sweet spot between 80%, which is harder to mix and fold, and 90%, which makes the dough rather <em>slumpy</em>, meaning particularly after shaping the ball shape flattens out more than I'd like.<br>- It is said that higher hydration will make the crumb more open, but I haven't really seen this.<br>
1	1	Temperature	The warmer the dough, the faster the fermentation.	- Measure the temperature of all the ingredients to determine the temperature of the dough<br>- With the very long fermentation time required by my recipe, I don't pay any attention to temperature.<br>- However, if I want to speed things along for some reason, I will, at the beginning, use water temperature of 90-100&amp;#8451;, and later during fermentation increase room temperature, or put in the oven with the light on.<br>- Also room temperature will make a big difference. I live in San Francisco, which seems to always be at about 68&amp;#8451;, so I don't usually need to pay attention.<br>- To cool things down, a refrigerator is useful.<br>
