	<h1>About The Flailing Baker</h1>
</header>

<article>
    <p>
    </p>
    <HR>
    <HR>

    <p>The Flailing Baker is the personal baking website of Alan Isaacs.
    </p>

    <p>First off, I LOVE 100% whole wheat sourdough bread: the rich,
        nutty, earthy flavor, the enticing sourness, the moist, chewy
        texture, the utter overwhelming <em>pleasure</em> of a mouthful 
        of warm wonderfulness accentuated by a salty pat of butter.
    </p>

    <p>And I LOVE baking: inhaling the aroma of fresh wheat that rises when 
        flour meets water, coaxing the right stretchiness from a ball of
        dough, marveling at the flouffy magic that happy yeast works on
        what would otherwise be just batter.
    </p>

    <p>What a joy and wonder is bread, to create and devour!</p>

    <p>So I'd love to just explain how to create a fullproof loaf every
        time. Yet ... I did put "flailing" in the name of this site,
        because, as it turns out,
        making that perfect loaf of bread turns out to be HARD.
    </p>

    <p>Usually with recipes, I bring my inner scientist to the fore:
         I tweak and tweak and tweak until FINALLY
        I achieve perfection: a sequence of steps that, when followed
        precisely, result in a repeatable product.
    </p>

    <p>With bread baking, well, it's not so simple. Tweak one thing and 
        something else changes; tweak nothing and things change anyway. 
        The number of variables is daunting (see the recipe), to say the 
        least.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working with 100% whole wheat flour is especially tricky. Adding a 
        portion of white flour does make it easier to achieve a nice 
        airy loaf, but at a sacrifice (for me anyway) of flavor. Okay, 
        maybe I'm a bit stubborn on that point.
    </p>

    <p>The key thing is, I don't want "flailing" to come across
        as negative. That process, trying again and again, two steps
        forward, two steps backâ€”there is <em>dignity</em> in it, even
        <em>honor</em>. It is the process of being human. And it is
        the scientist learning <em>humility</em>.
    </p>

    <p>To put it another way, I'm a scientist struggling to become an
        artist, and that's a worthwhile vocation, a necessary one, if
        one is to become more whole.
    </p>

    <p>The goal of The Flailing Baker then is to chronicle the journey
        I'm on with flour, water, salt and yeast, to describe 
        the joys and sorrows, the pleasure and pain . . . well, I'm 
        getting a little carried away. Mostly the journey involves
        eating lots of yummy bread; catastrophies are rare.
    </p>

    <p>Finally, I hope too
        that other bakers might find their pathways smoothed a bit by
        my own experiences. Onward!
